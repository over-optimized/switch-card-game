- **Week 7**: Fourth special card (8s, 7s, or Runs) - after production deployment
- **Week 8**: Advanced features (remaining trick cards, multiplayer)  
- **Week 9+**: Polish, additional platforms, user feedback

### üèóÔ∏è **Architecture Strategy (Updated for Consolidation):**
- **Network-First Architecture**: Eliminate local/network complexity by treating all games as network games
- **Mobile-First Desktop**: Proven mobile UX patterns extended to desktop with responsive scaling
- **Unified Component System**: Single responsive components replace mobile/desktop duplication
- **Simplified State Management**: One code path for all platforms and game modes
- **Technical Debt Resolution**: Critical consolidation before feature expansion

## üìù Notes for Revised Development Strategy

### New Development Philosophy

- **Perfect the core gameplay experience first** before adding complexity
- **Single-player experience** must be polished and fun
- **Local multiplayer** validates UI before networking challenges
- **Networking last** ensures solid foundation before real-time complexity

### Architecture Reminders

- Keep all game logic in shared package (can be used locally or networked)
- Use TypeScript strictly across all packages
- Build UI to work locally first, then add network sync later
- Test each feature thoroughly in isolation

### Code Organization

- Update FEATURES.md when completing major items
- Focus on TODO.md Week 1-2 tasks first (core gameplay)
- Create GitHub issues for bugs found during development
- Document game rule decisions as they're made

### Development Tips for Current Phase

- Test game with different card combinations manually
- Focus on visual feedback and user experience
- Make cards feel responsive and fun to interact with
- Consider adding sound effects early for better feedback
- Keep shared package built when making game engine changes

### Deployment Strategy Summary

- **Frontend**: Vercel (great for static sites, you know it well)
- **Backend**: Railway (excellent WebSocket support for real-time gaming)
- **Database**: Railway PostgreSQL when needed
- **Cost**: Free tiers sufficient for development and early production
