## 📝 Development Notes

### Architecture Decisions

- **Authoritative Server**: All game logic server-side for cheat prevention
- **Event-Driven**: WebSocket events for real-time gameplay
- **TypeScript First**: Full type safety across the stack
- **Modular Design**: Easy to add/modify features independently

### Technology Choices

- **Frontend**: HTML5 + TypeScript for broad compatibility
- **Backend**: Node.js for JavaScript consistency
- **Real-Time**: Socket.IO for robust WebSocket handling
- **Database**: Start with SQLite, migrate to PostgreSQL for scale
- **Testing**: Vitest for speed and modern features

### Future Considerations

- **Monetization**: Premium features, cosmetics, tournaments
- **Internationalization**: Multi-language support
- **Accessibility**: ARIA labels, keyboard navigation, screen reader support
- **Analytics**: User behavior tracking and game balance metrics
- **Content Moderation**: Chat filtering and player reporting systems
