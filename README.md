# Switch Card Game

A mobile-first multiplayer card game built with React and TypeScript. Play Switch with 2-4 players online with friends using shareable room codes, optimized for both mobile and desktop play.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- pnpm (recommended package manager)

### Installation

```bash
# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Build shared types
pnpm run build:shared

# Start development servers
pnpm run dev
```

This will start:

- Client development server at http://localhost:3000
- Backend server at http://localhost:3001

### Development Commands

```bash
# Development
pnpm run dev              # Start both client and server
pnpm run dev:client       # Client only
pnpm run dev:server       # Server only

# Building
pnpm run build            # Build all packages
pnpm run build:prod       # Production build with optimizations
pnpm run build:client     # Build client only
pnpm run build:server     # Build server only

# Testing
pnpm test                 # Run all tests
pnpm test:coverage        # Run tests with coverage

# Maintenance
pnpm clean                # Clean build artifacts from all packages

# Quality Checks
pnpm lint                 # Lint shared package
pnpm lint:all             # Lint all packages (shared, client, server)
pnpm format               # Format code with Prettier
pnpm ci                   # Full CI pipeline (lint + test + build)
```

## 🎮 How to Play

### Game Rules

- Each player starts with 7 cards
- Players take turns playing cards that match the top card's suit or rank
- If you can't play, draw a card from the deck
- First player to empty their hand wins!

### Multiplayer Setup

1. **Create Room**: One player creates a room and gets a 6-character room code
2. **Join Room**: Other players use the room code to join
3. **Start Game**: Room host starts the game when ready
4. **Play**: Take turns playing cards or drawing from deck

- **WebSocket Events**: Real-time communication between players
- **Type Safety**: Shared TypeScript interfaces across client/server

## 🧪 Testing

The project includes comprehensive test coverage:

```bash
# Run specific test suites
pnpm --filter shared test
pnpm --filter server test
pnpm --filter client test

# Generate coverage reports
pnpm test:coverage
```

## 🔧 Development Features

- **Hot Reloading**: Client and server automatically restart on changes
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript coverage with strict mode
- **Code Quality**: ESLint + Prettier with pre-commit hooks
- **Monorepo**: Efficient workspace management with pnpm
- **Testing**: Unit tests with Vitest and coverage reporting

## 🚀 Deployment

### Docker (Recommended)

```bash
# Build Docker images
docker build -t switch-client ./client
docker build -t switch-server ./server

# Run with Docker Compose
docker-compose up -d
```

### Manual Deployment

```bash
