## üö® CRITICAL PRIORITY (Week 5) - Architecture Consolidation

**‚ö†Ô∏è STOP - Complete This Before Any New Features ‚ö†Ô∏è**

The current architecture has grown complex with mobile/desktop duplication and local/network code paths. This technical debt must be resolved before adding more features to prevent exponential complexity growth.

### Critical Priority - Architecture Simplification Strategy

- [ ] **Network-First Architecture Implementation**
  - [ ] Eliminate local/network code path duplication in game store
  - [ ] Convert local games to localhost WebSocket connections
  - [ ] Remove `playCardsLocally` and local game branches from stores
  - [ ] Unify all games under optimistic update + rollback system
  - [ ] Implement lightweight local WebSocket server for "local" games
  - [ ] Test performance and reliability of network-first approach

- [ ] **Mobile-First Desktop Consolidation**
  - [ ] Replace `PlayerHandArea` with responsive `MobileHandArea`
  - [ ] Replace `MultiOpponentArea` with responsive `MobileOpponentArea`  
  - [ ] Replace desktop `GameInfo` with `MobileWinModal` for all platforms
  - [ ] Convert `GameBoard` to use mobile bottom sheet patterns with desktop scaling
  - [ ] Enhance mobile components with desktop-friendly sizing and interactions
  - [ ] Remove desktop-specific components entirely

- [ ] **Component Architecture Cleanup**
  - [ ] Map all [Mobile/Desktop] √ó [Local/Network] component combinations
  - [ ] Document duplication impact and maintenance burden
  - [ ] Create migration plan for gradual component consolidation
  - [ ] Implement feature flags for safe rollback during migration
  - [ ] Test unified components across all platforms and game modes

### Success Metrics (Must Achieve Before Proceeding)

- [ ] **Code Reduction**: Eliminate 40-50% of component duplication
- [ ] **Single Game Mode**: All games use network architecture (local = localhost)
- [ ] **Unified UX**: Mobile patterns work consistently on desktop
- [ ] **Simplified Testing**: Single test matrix instead of 4 combinations
- [ ] **Performance**: No regression in mobile performance
- [ ] **Maintainability**: Single codebase for all platforms and game modes

## üìù Notes for Revised Development Strategy

### New Development Philosophy

- **Perfect the core gameplay experience first** before adding complexity
- **Single-player experience** must be polished and fun
- **Local multiplayer** validates UI before networking challenges
- **Networking last** ensures solid foundation before real-time complexity

### Architecture Reminders

- Keep all game logic in shared package (can be used locally or networked)
- Use TypeScript strictly across all packages
- Build UI to work locally first, then add network sync later
- Test each feature thoroughly in isolation

### Code Organization

- Update FEATURES.md when completing major items
- Focus on TODO.md Week 1-2 tasks first (core gameplay)
- Create GitHub issues for bugs found during development
- Document game rule decisions as they're made

### Development Tips for Current Phase

- Test game with different card combinations manually
- Focus on visual feedback and user experience
- Make cards feel responsive and fun to interact with
- Consider adding sound effects early for better feedback
- Keep shared package built when making game engine changes

### Deployment Strategy Summary

- **Frontend**: Vercel (great for static sites, you know it well)
- **Backend**: Railway (excellent WebSocket support for real-time gaming)
- **Database**: Railway PostgreSQL when needed
- **Cost**: Free tiers sufficient for development and early production
