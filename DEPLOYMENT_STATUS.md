# 🚧 Deployment Status

## Current Status: Server Deployment in Progress

**Frontend (Vercel):** ⏸️ **Temporarily Disabled**  
**Backend (Railway):** 🚧 **Ready to Deploy**

### Why Vercel is Disabled

Vercel deployments are temporarily disabled via `.vercelignore` to prevent deploying a frontend that expects a Railway server that doesn't exist yet.

### Deployment Sequence

1. ✅ **Prepare Railway Configuration** - Complete
2. 🔄 **Merge to Main Branch** - In Progress  
3. 🟡 **Deploy Server to Railway** - Next
4. 🟡 **Update Production URLs** - After Railway deployment
5. 🟡 **Re-enable Vercel Deployments** - Final step

### What's Ready

- Railway deployment configuration completed
- Environment-based WebSocket URLs implemented
- Build process tested and working
- Server code production-ready

### Next Steps

1. Merge feature branch to main
2. Deploy server to Railway using `RAILWAY_DEPLOY.md` guide
3. Update `.env.production` with actual Railway URL
4. Remove `.vercelignore` to re-enable Vercel deployments
5. Test full production environment

### Files to Update After Railway Deployment

- `client/.env.production` - Update with actual Railway URL
- Remove `.vercelignore` - Re-enable Vercel deployments
- Update `DEPLOYMENT_STATUS.md` - Mark as complete

**⚠️ Important:** Do not remove `.vercelignore` until Railway server is deployed and environment URLs are updated!
